### Introduction:
Thank you for taking the time to do this code test. 

The test is divided into 3 steps. Try to complete each step before proceeding to the next one. We do not presume that you will complete every step in this assignment, rather, we wish that you do your absolute best at solving each step. If you don't manage to solve any particular step, don't worry, you may submit your solution anyway.

### What To Submit
Submit all files that are in this repository, with your additions to the code.

Send us the solution files, or send us a link to a GIT repo with your solution files.

### What We Look For In Your Solution:
We look for:
1. Scalability of your solution - How well does your code serve as a foundation for expansion of the code? 
2. Ability To Learn - How well can you adapt to a newly given, small, code environment?
3. D.R.Y - Keep the code D.R.Y (Do not Repeat Yourself)
4. Problem Solving Ability - How well can you find information within documentation?

### Useful Documentation:
* [MeteorJS](https://docs.meteor.com/) 
* [BlazeJS](http://blazejs.org/)
* [Import / Export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)

### Where To Implement Your Solutions:
Write code in to the existing files in this project. Add files if you have to.

### How To Get Started:
Either download this project as a ZIP, or fork this repo. After you've downloaded this test to your computer, do the following:

1. Open your Terminal / Command Line. 
2. Navigate to the directory with the code. (Ex. ```` cd Code-test````)
3. If it's your first time running the code, run the command ```` meteor npm install --save @babel/runtime ````
4. After that has finished, to start the program, simply run the command ```` meteor ````
5. If you have any issues or get error messages you're unfamiliar with, please refer to the MeteorJS documentation, linked above! 

### Installation Problems
If you encounter any installation issues that seem tricky to solve on your own, please do contact us. The test's purpose is not to see if you can install different development tools. The purpose is to see how you can adapt to a new dev-environment.

### Three Assignments:
1. Use the JSON object called "data" from the file data.js. Display a card for each "color" in the data. Display the name of the color and a sample of the color. For the cards, you will find a template named card.html. Use this template when displaying the cards. 

2. Once you have completed step one, instead of displaying all the colors in the data.js file, randomly display 5 unique colors. For this step it is okay to use the page refresh to generate new random cards. make sure the cards are unique and that the program never crashes because of your “random” algorithm. 

3. Finally, implement some type of <form> where you can select how many random cards to display on the screen (within the bounds of the data.js objects length). The page should show these cards without the page refreshing. 

(4). If have spare time and would like to impress us, make sure that the page is responsive for phones.
